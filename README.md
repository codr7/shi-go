# shi/Go

## Introduction
This project aims to implement [shi](https://github.com/codr7/shi) in Go.

## Status
Work is currently stalled waiting for the Go compiler team to get their act together and fix the internal compiler errors I keep running into.

Feel free to have a look by running `make` in the project root.

Deleting [this](https://github.com/codr7/shi-go/blob/main/src/shi/call.go) file from the project is currently all it takes to solve the problem, but the problem randomly re-appears when I add more code.

Any ideas are most welcome!
